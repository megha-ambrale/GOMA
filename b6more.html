    <h3 style="color: navy;">How Does We Make Paneer Processing Hassle free?</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="chesse">
            <img src="img/b6.png" style="border-radius: 30px;">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">Paneer – also called Cottage cheese in English is one of the most important dairy products in Indian and is used widely as an ingredient in the North Indian vegetarian cuisine – because of the abundance of dairy and dairy products. It is a type of cheese that has a sweet taste and matches the Indian palette perfectly and many Indian dishes are famous in the world with Paneer as the main ingredient.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">An interesting thing to note here is about the consumption & Paneer consumption is growing in India by 10-12 % each year. Not just in India, but Paneer is famous in many Asia Pacific countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">However, the production is now spreading throughout the world, i.e, even though cheese manufacturing is widely famous in other parts of the western world, manufacturing cottage cheese, i.e. Paneer is a recent phenomenon.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">There are several reasons for the growing demand for paneer and its consumption. There are changing food habits, increasing fast-food chains, and consumption of pasta, pizzas, and easy availability of raw materials such as milk. The increasing trend of vegetarianism has also led to the increased demand for paneer which is used as a substitute for meat in many dishes.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">With the growth in the dairy industry, many avenues are opening up in India. In addition, therefore, starting a small-scale paneer manufacturing project is highly lucrative for new and small entrepreneurs. And if they are already in the dairy business, starting paneer manufacturing is easier with help of the existing process. And for any help needed, we are here to help you.</p>
            <br>
            <h6 style="color: navy; font-size: 23px;">Paneer Manufacturing Process at GOMA:</h6>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">Traditionally, paneer is made from cow and buffalo milk in India. However, buffalo milk is preferred in the production process because of its high solid content which results in a better final product. In the process, standardized milk is heated to 90 °C and then cooled to 76°C to coagulate the milk. Then, the contents of the vessels are poured over a Muslim cloth to separate the coagulum from whey. The coagulum so obtained after straining is then lightly pressed to facilitate the formation of paneer block. Later, the pressed block is further deepened in the cold water followed by vacuum sealing and packing.</p>
